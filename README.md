# Flert

API requirements:
* Function takes a girl
* If girl is hot, she eats free
* Random odds on a kiss
* High chance of staying the night if full.

Requested function can be found in the Harry class.
Users are expected to supply their own implementations of the AbstractGirl class, as I currently don't have access to any instances. :(

Future updates may include the ability for Harry to actually eat and pay for the restaurant the date is happening at...

### Version 1.0.0
* First release
